## what is namespace:

If 2 or more functions have same name but differenct parameter in a class, then 'function overloading' system of visual studio automatically chooses the right one that matches the parameter. However, if both functions have same name and same parameter, or we make a function with same name and parameter with one of STL functions, 'function overloading' cannot happen.
