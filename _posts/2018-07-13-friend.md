## Friend functions

A class can define an external function as a friend function and it allows the friend function to access all the members of the class - including private members.
They must require an explicit parameter to access an object.
We don't prefix friend functions with the ClassName::syntax, because they are not members of the class.


## Friend classes

A class can define another class as its friend. A friend class, just like friend functions, can access all the members of the first class.
