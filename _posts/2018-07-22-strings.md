## Introductions to string streams

The standard C++ library defines a **std::stringstream class** that allow you to read and write data to/from a string using the stream operators >> and <<.
The class is defined in <sstream> header file. std::stringstream is actually inherited from std::iostream, so it inherits all the capabilities from the class.  

stringstream can be used pretty much like string type(yet the way how to use is different) but there is a big difference. the strings in stringstream is separatable wrt whitespace.

We can write formatted data to a std::stringstream object using << operator like below.

```C++
    #include <sstream>// For std::stringstream.
    …
    
    std::stringstream stream;
    stream << "Jane" << " " << 42 << " " << 15000 << std::endl; 

```

We can read formatted data from the object above.

```c++
    #include <sstream>// For std::stringstream.
    #include <string> // For std::string.
    …
        
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double salary;
    stream >> name >> age >> salary;
```


## setting and getting the content of a string stream

We can set or get the content of a std::stringstream object by calling str() method. There are 2 overloaded versions.  

**void str(const string& s); vs. std::string str() const;**: the left one is used to set the content for a string stream and the other one is used to get the content for s string stream.

Here is an example.  

```c++
// create a string stream object.
std::stringstream st;

// set the string content for a stringstream.
st.str("Kim 22 45000");

// get the string content from a stringstream.
std::cout << st.str() << std::endl;

// This part is important!!
std::string name;
int age;
double salary;
st >> name >> age >> salary; // This is possible!!!! as I mentioned above!!!
```


## Creating a string stream from an existing string

There are 2 big scenarios: **1. overwriting an existing string with new content, 2. parsing an existing formatted string to extract values.**  

First, if we want to overwrite an existing code, "********************", with our stream,

```c++
    // Create a stringstream object to write to an existing string.
    std::string str = "********************";
    std::stringstream stream(str);
    
    // Do some output.
    stream << "Jane" << " " << 42 << " " << 15000;
 ```
 
 The out put looks like this: Jane 42 15000*******
 
 
Second, 

```c++
    // Create a stringstream object to read from an existing string.
    std::string str = "Jane 42 15000";
    std::stringstream stream(str);
    
    // Read formatted data from stringstream.
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double salary;
    stream >> name >> age >> salary;
 ```
 
 Those two usages of stringstream on an existing string are important.
 
 
 ## Write-only and read-only string streams
 
 There are read-only and write-only operations: std:: istringstream(outputs characters) and std::ostringstream(inputs characters).
 
 ```c++
     // Create an ostringstream object, which supports write-only operations.
    std::ostringstream stream1;
    
    stream1 << "Jane" << " " << 42 << " " << 15000 << std::endl;
    
    // Create an istringstream object, which supports read-only operations.
    std::istringstream stream2(stream1.str());
    
    // Read formatted data from istringstream.
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double salary;
    stream2 >> name >> age >> salary;
    
    std::cout
        << "Name: " << name << std::endl
        << "Age: " << age << std::endl
        << "Salary:" << salary << std::endl; 
 ```
