안녕!

   I'm Beomjoo. I'm a current undergraduate student in **University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA)** and my major is **Computer Science & Engineering**. I am an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning lover. My background is more of software than hardware, but I'm also interested in hardware as well and that's why I am majoring an interdisciplinary area on both computer science and computer engineering. I have done several kinds of of self and team projects related to SW.

  + In 2016, I developed an android game application called 'sprint on galaxy' using *C# on unity platform* by myself as a summer project. It was my first self project so not a masterpiece, but it's not bad.
  + In 2017, I participated a CAPSTONE undergraduate research team as a software engineer. I developed a SW program that goes into a rover(a small car) and helps it to avoid upcoming obstacles as it moves forward. I used *Arduino and Python* for the program.
  + In 2018, I'm working at California Institute of Technology(Caltech) starting from summer 2018 as a part-time software engineer in Mars Habitat Project supported by NASA. I'm developing a software that operates on the robot arm that builds our model house. After the prototype of our house is completely built and if we get a final confirm by NASA, it would be sent to Mars and built on it. We're using *Python on Linux Ubuntu platform with Gazebo plugin and MoveIt*!

   
   I'm also a semi-professional soccer player. I've been palying for all schools that I attended ever since back in elementary school. I play winger and attacking midfielder. I love pick-up games so do not hesitate to hit me if you play soccer near westwood! I will be there unless I have another computer programming project LOL

   I play the piano. My favorite pieces of music to play are *Chopin's Fantaisie Impromptu Op.66* and *Yuki Kuramoto's Lake Louise*.
   
   I play the cello. I'm not a good cellist, I'd been learning it only for about 3 years, but the sound of Cello always relieves me so I want to keep learning it if time permits.
   
   I'm a passionate traveller. The number of countries that I have visited is 4, which is not even decent, but I used to go to short trips no longer than 3 days many, many times during weekends. Especially for the last 3 years, my family and I visited and toured lots and lots of places in the U.S. and Canada. I'm going to post how marvelous the trips were on 'Travelling' section on my blog.
