안녕!! I'm Beomjoo, current undergraduate student in University of California, Los Angeles. My major is CSE(Computer Science & Engineering). I love Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning especially. My background is more of software than hardware, but I'm interested in hardware as well and that's why I am majoring an interdisciplinary area on both computer science and computer engineering.

I'm also a semi-professional soccer player. I've been palying for all schools that I attended ever since back in elementary school. I play winger and attacking midfielder. I love pick-up games so do not hesitate to hit me if you play soccer near westwood! I will be there unless I have another computer programming project LOL
