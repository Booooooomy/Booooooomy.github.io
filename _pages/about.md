안녕!! 
I'm Beomjoo, current undergraduate student in University of California, Los Angeles. My major is CSE(Computer Science & Engineering). I love Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning especially in the software area. So my background is more of software than hardware, but I'm interested in hardware as well and that's why I am majoring an interdisciplinary area on both computer science and computer engineering.

I'm also a semi-professional soccer player. I've been palying for all schools that I attended ever since back in elementary school. I play winger and attacking midfielder. I love pick-up games so do not hesitate to hit me if you play soccer near westwood! I will be there unless I have another computer programming project LOL

I play the piano. My 2 favorite pieces of music to play are Chopin's Fantaisie Impromptu Op.66 and Yuki Kuramoto's Lake Louise.
I play the cello. I'm not a good cellist, I'd been learning it onlt for about 3 years, but the sound that Cello makes relieves me a lot so I want to keep learning it if time permits.
I'm also a passionate traveller. The number of countries that I have visited are only 4, but I used to go  short trips that are no longer than 3, 4 days maaaany times during weekends. Especially, for the last 3 years, my family and I covered lots and lots of places in the U.S. and Canada. The posts about big trips are on 'Travelling' section on my blog.
